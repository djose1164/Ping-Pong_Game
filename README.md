# Hello to everyone

***I'm Jose S. Daniel, a student of mechatronics; learning C programing and Git yet jajaj xD.***

## Thanks for looking at on this project

*In this proyect; I'm trying to creat a Ping-Pong game the most decent possible*

### This is one of my most challenging project so far in C

**As you are guessing I'm a newbie in this!**

- [ ] I almost finish the base of this Ping-Pong game;
- [x] **If you have some advice to me; don't hesitate in letting me know them!**

***Ok, the principal error is concerning to the movement of the ball. When it's moving it left garbage of itself but I almost fix it.***

- [ ] Delete the rest of garbage left from the movement.
- [ ] I need to add the features of movement to the player and AI.

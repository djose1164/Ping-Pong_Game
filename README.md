# Hello to everyone

## Thanks to looking at on this project

### This is one of my most challenging project so far in C

**As you are guessing I'm a newbie in this!**

-[ ]I almost finish the base of this Ping-Pong game;
-[x]**If you have some advice to me; don't hesitate in letting me know them!**

***Ok, the principal error is concerning to the movement of the ball. When it's moving it left garbage of itself but I almost fix it.***

-[ ]Delete the rest of garbage left from the movement.
-[ ]I need to add the features of movement to the player and AI.

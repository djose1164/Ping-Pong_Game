<b><h1>Hello to everyone!</h1></b>

<p>
    Thanks to looking at on this project!

    This is one of my most challenging project so far in C. 
    
    As you are guessing I'm a newbie in this!
    
    I almost finish the base of this Ping-Pong game; if you have some advice to me, don't hesitate in
    let me know them!

    Ok, the principal error is concerning to the movement of the ball. Whe it's moving it left garbage of 
    itself but I almost fix it.

    And this' not a bug; but I need to add yet the features of movement to the player and AI.
